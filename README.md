# React-Movie Application
The project aimed to develop a movie database and management system that includes information about movies currently in theaters as well as upcoming releases. The system allows users to view and manage movie details, including titles, genres, actors, and theaters.

# System Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture where the frontend is built with React and TypeScript, and the backend is developed using .NET. The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs to fetch and update movie information.

# Technologies Used

  Frontend:
    React, 
    TypeScript, 
    HTML/CSS.
    
  Backend:
    .NET, 
    C#
    
  Database:
    Sqlite
    
# Features

1. Create, View, Delete, and Edit Operations: Users can perform CRUD operations on genres, actors, movies, and movie theaters, allowing for easy management of movie-related data.
2. Advanced Filtering: Users can filter movies by title, genre, upcoming releases, and movies currently in theaters, providing a personalized browsing experience.
   
# Learnings

1. React Fundamentals: Gained a solid understanding of React and learned how to efficiently structure components for building dynamic user interfaces.
2. .NET Development: Familiarized with the .NET framework and C# programming language, exploring various tools and libraries for backend development.
3. API Design: Learned about design principles and best practices for building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Web API, facilitating seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
4.  Database Interaction: Implemented CRUD operations to interact with the database, gaining insights into data modeling and database management with Sqlite.

# Challenges
1. Managing Version Conflicts: Faced challenges related to version conflicts between frontend and backend dependencies, requiring careful management and resolution to maintain compatibility.
2. Naming Conventions: Encountered difficulties with naming conventions for variables and objects, necessitating clear and consistent naming practices to enhance code readability and maintainability.
